# Pareto Learning Repository 🚀

_Following the 80/20 rule for maximum learning efficiency_

## Overview

This repository documents my journey following the **Pareto Principle** (80/20 rule) to master full-stack development with modern technologies. The goal is to focus on the 20% of concepts that deliver 80% of the results, building practical skills through hands-on projects rather than getting lost in theoretical rabbit holes.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

The Pareto approach means:

- **Focus on fundamentals** that unlock the most possibilities
- **Build projects immediately** rather than endless tutorial consumption
- **Learn by doing** with real-world applications
- **Document key insights** that provide maximum leverage
- **Prioritize practical skills** over academic completeness

## 📚 Learning Path Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

**Core Technologies:** Elixir, Phoenix, JavaScript, React, TypeScript

### Phase 2: Advanced Full-Stack (Months 3-4)

**Focus:** Phoenix LiveView, Real-time apps, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

### Phase 3: Data & AI Integration (Months 5-6)

**Focus:** Databases, System Design, AI/ML Integration

### Phase 4: Production & Business (Months 7-8)

**Focus:** Terraform, Testing, CI/CD, SaaS Productization

## 📝 Notes

### Learning Principles

1. **Action over perfection:** Ship working code, refine later
2. **Compound learning:** Each project builds on previous knowledge
3. **Focus over breadth:** Master core concepts before exploring edge cases
4. **Real-world application:** Every concept learned must be immediately applied

### Weekly Commitment

- **Minimum:** 15-20 hours per week
- **Optimal:** 25-30 hours per week
- **Structure:** 60% hands-on coding, 30% learning new concepts, 10% documentation
